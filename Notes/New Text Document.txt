- RN CLI
---------------------------------------------------------------
-- Advantages
1. The Size of The Apps is Usually Small (Starting From 5 MB++)
2. Development is Fast as Compare to Expo.
3. We Can Link Native Code with Our Javascript Code.

-- Dis-advantages
1. We Need some more efforts as compare to Expo CLI to Configure and start the react native app.
2. We Need Android Studio or Xcode for the setup and development.
3. We Need MacOS during development for iOS Apps as well as for production.

- Expo CLI
---------------------------------------------------------------
-- Advantages
1. we need very less efforts to configure and start the expo app.
2. it doesn't need Android Studio or Xcode for the setup & development.
3. You Will Not Require MacOS During Development of iOS Apps, but yes, will be required for production

-- Dis-advantages
1. The Size of the app is usually bigger (Starting From 30 MB++).
